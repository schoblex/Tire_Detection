# Project Setup Guide

Follow these steps to set up and run the project:

---

## 1. Extract the ZIP Files
Unzip the provided `.zip` files into the project directory.  
Make sure that `pics.z01` and `pics.zip` are being combined.
Make sure the extracted folders are in the correct location before proceeding.

---

## 2. Install Dependencies
The project dependencies are listed in `requirements.txt`.  
To install them, run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 3. CUDA Support
# What is CUDA?

CUDA(Compute Unified Device Architecture) is NVIDIAâ€™s parallel computing platform.
It allows deep learning frameworks like PyTorch or TensorFlow to run computations on your GPU, making training and inference much faster compared to using only the CPU

# How the Code Handles CUDA
* If CUDA is installed:
the project will use your GPU automatically.



* If CUDA is not installed: 
You need to delete  `device= 0` where it is.
